                    <h2>Tumblr is about visual storytelling.</h2>
                    <p>Tumblr blogs are more like a website than a social fan page, and that's what makes them magic. They enable brands to create immersive visual stories that are unlike any other social network. Tumblr is also the most viral social network, with 18% of all posts shared to Pinterest within one day of being published.</p>
